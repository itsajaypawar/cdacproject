Hypothetical conjectures to be avoided – Amputation of left leg of Cart Puller aged 55 years – Loss of earning
capacity determined at 50% by Tribunal and High Court – Determination based on account that injured could
change job – Finding of another job at his age, held, impossible – Any scaling down of compensation should
require something more tangible than a hypothetical conjecture that notwithstanding disability, victim could make
up for loss of income by changing his vocation or by adopting other means of livelihood – Party advocating for
lower amount of compensation must plead and show that victim enjoyed some legal protection or that victim had in
fact changed his vocation or means of livelihood and by virtue of such change was deriving some income – Loss of
earning capacity of Cart Puller, held, would not be less than 90% - Thus, Compensation for loss of future earnings
determined at Rs.3,56,400 instead of Rs.2,58,000 as awarded by Courts below – Total compensation awarded at
Rs.4,01,400/- along with interest at 9% p.a. from dated of filing Claim Petition till date of payment – Persons with
